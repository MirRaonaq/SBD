Hi John,

Congratulations on your full time offer! 

We at Microsoft are glad to begin the next chapter of your life. In this journey we will impact the world by working on products that empower billions of people across the planet.
Details about your pay and benefits will be mailed to you in 2-3 business days. Sometime next week our logistics team will reach out to you for relocation. We know moving can be costly and time consuming, but no worries. Microsoft will pay for all your travel and shipping expenses. As little as clothing to as big as your car, shipping for everything will be covered. Your office at Microsoft will come fully furnished. All required software will be installed into your computer.

If you choose to decline your offer from Microsoft, please do so before 10/30/2018.
Again, congratulations on your offer! Let me know if you need anything at all and please contact me with questions. I’ll plan to be in touch with you next week if we don’t connect before then.

Lisa, John, and Elle will be in contact.

Best,

Microsoft
