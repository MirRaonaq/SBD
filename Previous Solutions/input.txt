Opening of the session
I declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European
Parliament.
Agenda
Mr President, the second item on this morningâ€™s agenda
is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and
chocolate products, for which I am the rapporteur.
Quite by accident I learnt yesterday, at 8.30 p.m., that
the vote was to take place at noon today.
